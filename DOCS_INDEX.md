# GO IRL Documentation Status Registry

Single entry point for GO IRL documentation status, ownership, and conflict tracking.

Use this file before changing product logic, architecture, QA flow, beta scope, release wording, or historical product philosophy.

## Absolute source-of-truth rules

- `docs/GO_IRL_CONSTITUTION.md` is the **absolute source of truth** for GO IRL philosophy and architecture principles.
- `README.md` is the **source of truth for the current code scope**: implemented features, stack, setup, and current runtime model.
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` is the source of truth for release state and must not contradict `README.md`.
- `docs/SPORT_COACH_MVP.md` is the source of truth for Sport Coach MVP 1.1 boundaries after this cleanup.
- `docs/MVP_DOC_AUDIT.md` is the source of truth for known documentation conflicts.
- `docs/MISSING_SECTIONS.md` is the source of truth for missing documentation boundaries.
- Historical snapshot files must not be used for code generation.
- Bible files are preserved historical/product sources. Do not rewrite them during technical cleanup.
- Do not change `.env`, secrets, Supabase RLS, auth, or destructive SQL without explicit approval.

## Current documentation conflicts

| Conflict | Files | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Trusted Auth was both current production model and public blocker. | `README.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `PATCH_REPORT.md` | `RELEASE_NOTES.md` now marks Trusted Auth as `[SHIPPED/PRODUCTION PATH]`; operational checks remain. |
| Coach UI promise exceeded current implementation. | `docs/SPORT_COACH_MVP.md`, `src/components/CoachRequestPanel.tsx` | Added factual UI section; Role Choice and Review Flow moved to `[FUTURE VISION 1.2+]`. |
| Sprint 0 Netlify proof conflicted with current Vercel beta flow. | `SPRINT0_STATUS.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `BETA_CHECKLIST.md` | `SPRINT0_STATUS.md` marked historical/deprecated. |
| Legacy setup docs could mislead AI/code generation. | `SETUP.md`, `SETUP_RU.md`, `CHECKLIST.md` | Added historical/deprecated warning banners. |
| Generated snapshots could be mistaken for current docs. | `GO_IRL_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `PATCH_REPORT.md` | Added warning banners and status registry entries. |
| Activity Chat, Browser Demo Mode, Weather, Telegram Mini App limits are not fully centralized. | `docs/MISSING_SECTIONS.md` | Missing-section registry created. |

## Maintenance rule

Update this registry when:

- a document is added, moved, deprecated, or promoted to source of truth;
- release blockers change;
- future vision becomes MVP scope;
- code implementation contradicts docs;
- Supabase migration/auth/RLS docs are audited.
