# GO IRL Documentation Status Registry

Single entry point for GO IRL documentation status, ownership, and conflict tracking.

Use this file before changing product logic, architecture, QA flow, beta scope, release wording, or historical product philosophy.

## Absolute source-of-truth rules

- `docs/GO_IRL_CONSTITUTION.md` is the **absolute source of truth** for GO IRL philosophy and architecture principles.
- `docs/MARKET_POSITIONING.md` is the **source of truth for market positioning and MVP feature filtering**.
- `docs/COMPETITOR_WATCH.md` is the **source of truth for competitor signals**, but competitor signals must not automatically become MVP scope.
- `README.md` is the **source of truth for the current code scope**: implemented features, stack, setup, and current runtime model.
- `RELEASE_NOTES.md` is the source of truth for release state and must not contradict `README.md`.
- `docs/SPORT_COACH_MVP.md` is the source of truth for Sport Coach MVP 1.1 boundaries after this cleanup.
- `docs/MVP_DOC_AUDIT.md` is the source of truth for known documentation conflicts.
- `docs/MISSING_SECTIONS.md` is the source of truth for missing documentation boundaries.
- `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_AUDIT.md` is the source of truth for current schema-vs-future-schema documentation conflicts.
- Historical snapshot files must not be used for code generation.
- Bible files are preserved product sources. New Bible boundary chapters can describe MVP scope, but Bible files must not override current code, Supabase schema, auth, or RLS.
- Do not change `.env`, secrets, Supabase RLS, auth, or destructive SQL without explicit approval.

## Current documentation conflicts

| Conflict | Files | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| Trusted Auth was both current production model and public blocker. | `README.md`, `RELEASE_NOTES.md`, `PATCH_REPORT.md` | `RELEASE_NOTES.md` now marks Trusted Auth as `[SHIPPED/PRODUCTION PATH]`; operational checks remain. |
| Coach UI promise exceeded current implementation. | `docs/SPORT_COACH_MVP.md`, `src/components/CoachRequestPanel.tsx` | Added factual UI section; Role Choice and Review Flow moved to `[FUTURE VISION 1.2+]`. |
| Sprint 0 Netlify proof conflicted with current Vercel beta flow. | `SPRINT0_STATUS.md`, `DEPLOYMENT.md`, `BETA_CHECKLIST.md` | `SPRINT0_STATUS.md` marked historical/deprecated. |
| Legacy setup docs could mislead AI/code generation. | `SETUP.md`, `SETUP_RU.md`, `CHECKLIST.md` | Added historical/deprecated warning banners. |
| Generated snapshots could be mistaken for current docs. | `GO_IRL_DOCUMENTATION.md`, `PATCH_REPORT.md` | Added warning banners and status registry entries. |
| Activity Chat, Browser Demo Mode, Weather, Telegram Mini App limits were not fully centralized. | `docs/MISSING_SECTIONS.md`, `BETA_TESTING.md`, `docs/EventLifecycle.md`, `docs/MVP_STABILIZATION_PLAN.md` | Boundaries now documented; chat expiry still needs product/schema decision. |
| Bible files could be mistaken for current MVP, Supabase schema, or implementation plan. | `docs/bible/*`, `ROADMAP.md`, `BACKLOG.md`, `docs/MARKET_POSITIONING.md` | Guardrails added; current MVP boundary chapters added; Bible remains not final. |
| Future DB architecture conflicted with current Supabase migrations. | `docs/Database.md`, `docs/bible/03-database-design.md`, `supabase/migration_v8_activity_chat.sql` | `docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA_AUDIT.md` created; `docs/Database.md` marked future architecture. |

## Maintenance rule

Update this registry when:

- a document is added, moved, deprecated, or promoted to source of truth;
- release blockers change;
- future vision becomes MVP scope;
- code implementation contradicts docs;
- Bible files are audited or reclassified;
- Supabase migration/auth/RLS docs are audited.
